#   This script does not provide a valid CGI response or a valid HTTP/1.1
#   response.  In fact, it does not even produce valid HTML.  It is meant to
#   help you investigate the variables and other parameters your server is
#   passing to the script.  You may want to turn the prints into writes to a
#   a log file especially when you start redirecting stdout of the script.
